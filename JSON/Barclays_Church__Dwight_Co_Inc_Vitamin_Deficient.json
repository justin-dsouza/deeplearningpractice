fourteen","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"Trends in the Vitamins business highlight fundamental issues even prior to recent execution missteps, suggesting slower growth is here to

growth profile of the company we did worry that the company, having violated its traditional acquisition criteria for asset light businesses that are gross margin accretive, was in relatively unchartered territory.","wordCount":56},{"sentence":"Though this summer was the first time management highlighted operating issues within the business, the reality is that vitamins' contribution to

percent growth Avid was enjoying at the time of acquisition, but market dynamics changed far more swiftly than we expected.","wordCount":31},{"sentence":"Even with the benefit of expanding

+forty percent CAGR since the acquisition, the children's side in contrast, has declined two percent and Avid is losing significant share in both segments.","wordCount":32},{"sentence":"Gummy vitamin market development has seemingly matched expectations; the disappointment is in Avid's participation in that growth.","wordCount":17},{"sentence":"Part of Church's strategic rationale for acquiring Avid was the opportunity to grow the adult gummy vitamin category and to leverage the company's number one position in this burgeoning market.","wordCount":30},{"sentence":"There was always an assumption of some share slippage but with growth rates remaining very strong thanks to category growth .","wordCount":20},{"sentence":"This looks to have largely played out but with a terribly significant downdraft from both market declines and share losses in the children's side of the market.","wordCount":27},{"sentence":"To frame this numerically, adult market growth has been at a +forty percent CAGR since the acquisition while children's is down two percent and worsening to six percent in two thousand fourteen and nine percent YTD.","wordCount":36},{"sentence":"We think Church has been proactive in trying to protect its moat and expand its offering in adult gummies.","wordCount":19},{"sentence":"Specifically, given the expected pressure on Vitafusion from mainstream vitamin brands like Centrum, Nature Made and Schiff investing behind gummies, the company has attempted to extend audience/usage beyond traditional formulas like Vitamin C and Multivitamins and into more unique variations for Heart Health and Immunity.","wordCount":45},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, new product news has been little more than a hamster wheel to maintain facings and Vitafusion now holds just a ~thirty two percent share of the adult category, down from forty six percent at the peak in two thousand twelve.","wordCount":41},{"sentence":"Total Avid adult gummies grew at half the rate of category growth in two thousand fourteen and is trending at less than one third the rate of category YTD.","wordCount":29},{"sentence":"For children's, performance is even worse but reflective of category trends as quoted above more so than shares.","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"Lil' Critters shares are down three hundred bps to twenty nine percent versus the peak in two thousand thirteen.","wordCount":19},{"sentence":"Coupled with category declines, this has translated into a remarkable seventeen percent decline in the business YTD.","wordCount":17},{"sentence":"Going forward, we have assumed that the execution issues of two thousand fifteen ease and the business performs a bit better in two thousand sixteen.","wordCount":25},{"sentence":"That said, we expect Avid to continue to be a share donor and have assumed four six percent growth for the business longer term.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"While Cat Litter has picked up the slack from Vitamins thus far, we see near term risk to top line from a competitive resurgence.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"Church and Dwight has had tremendous momentum in its Cat Litter business since Arm and Hammer Clump and Seal first hit shelves in fourQthirteen.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"Using Nielsen trends as a gauge, the company's litter business grew ~fourx the category in two thousand fourteen, gaining +two hundred fifty bps of share and contributing ~two.three","wordCount":29},{"sentence":"Of course, we've been wary of a competitive response in a category that has proven so receptive to innovation Â­ specifically remembering that Church's business declined two percent in two thousand thirteen on the heels of Nestle Tidy Cats lightweight launch.","wordCount":41},{"sentence":"Barclays | Church and Dwight Co., Inc. performance has been resilient even following Clorox's Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme launch in FoneQfifteen, we do worry that this is about to change.","wordCount":30},{"sentence":"Remarkably, Cat Litter accounted for over forty percent of total company sales growth and ~seventy percent of Consumer Domestic in two thousand fourteen and only a slightly smaller contribution YTD so it makes sense that we'd be watching this business closely.","wordCount":41},{"sentence":"There has already been some moderate slowing in A and H's pace of share gain YTD, surely just as we are nearing the two year mark for the Clump and Seal innovation being in market.","wordCount":35},{"sentence":"We do note that historically the brand has launched a material innovation every two years and that the Clump and Seal launch at the end of two thousand thirteen came a year late versus that historical pattern.","wordCount":37},{"sentence":"More notably, we are keen to see the impact that Clorox's upcoming Fresh Step with Febreze has on the market in light of the co branding success for Febreze with Glad Odor Shield trash bags.","wordCount":35},{"sentence":"Glad trash sales had been declining at an eight percent clip for the year prior to the threeQten launch and staged a major trend reversal, growing +one.five","wordCount":28},{"sentence":"As we see it, Febreze co branding is a stellar fit for the Cat Litter category.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"We are taking down our estimates for twoHfifteen Consumer Domestic organic sales growth to +two.two percent to reflect a deceleration in shipments as retailers even out inventories, leaving our total company organic estimate at +one.six percent for the balance of the year.","wordCount":44},{"sentence":"We expect softer top line growth to shave ~onec off our current Cfifteen EPS outlook to dollar three.twenty","wordCount":19},{"sentence":"Looking ahead into two thousand sixteen, with Vitamins and Litter expected to be less robust contributors, we now expect Consumer Domestic to grow +two.five","wordCount":25},{"sentence":"percent in two thousand sixteen and are modelling total company organic growth at two.eight percent .","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"Lower sales growth has tweaked our two thousand sixteen estimate down by dollar .four/sh to dollar three.fifty","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"Cat Litter accounted for ~seventy percent of the growth in Consumer Domestic in two thousand fourteen, so it makes sense that we'd be
