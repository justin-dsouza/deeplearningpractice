software companies as they signal a strategic importance of a vendor to a customer, in addition to the more obvious benefit of higher sales.","wordCount":33},{"sentence":"We compiled the number of million dollar deals completed in the last year for the vendors that disclose that number, and compared that to the total billings number, as well as the customer count.","wordCount":34},{"sentence":"We found that ServiceNow is doing quite well with large deals, finishing the year with two hundred thirty customers with ACV of dollar onemn or greater.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"Taking this as their large deal number, we see that they also had the highest proportion of large deals per customer, at seventy seven per thousand customers, of any company in this analysis.","wordCount":33},{"sentence":"There is a logical correlation between ASPs and large deal generation, since companies whose average selling price is closer to dollar onemn are more likely to achieve dollar onemn+ deals.","wordCount":30},{"sentence":"With this is mind, it makes sense that ServiceNow is seeing such success with large deals.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"Hortonworks has also seen strong traction with large deals, and completed twenty two dollar onemn plus deals in FYfifteen despite having only existed for five years.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"Generally, large deals take time to ramp as customers increase their spend year after year, which can usually be seen in a cohort analysis.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"We view this early success as a positive leading indicator for the company's future performance, especially when viewed in concert with the one hundred fifty nine percent average dollar based net expansion rate.","wordCount":33},{"sentence":"Although Hortonworks only has eight hundred customers, it has over twenty seven dollar onemn+ deals per customer.","wordCount":17},{"sentence":"Splunk has worked hard to increase its large deal count, and the work appears to be paying off.","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"The company introduced EAAs, and more recently unlimited ELAs, to give customers greater predictability in their Splunk costs.","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"Despite ASPs of only dollar fiftyk, they still achieved nine large deals per thousand customers.","wordCount":15},{"sentence":"We expect that Splunk will continue to see solid growth in its dollar onemn+ deal count going forward as it strengthens its large deal process.","wordCount":25},{"sentence":"We believe that Qlik and Tableau have lots of runway to increase their large deal count.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"Those two companies have, by far, the lowest proportion of large deals, each at less than one per thousand customers.","wordCount":20},{"sentence":"While this makes sense given the land and expand model that usually starts with just a few licenses, we believe that the ability to grow past dollar onebn in revenue will hinge upon moving up in the enterprise and transacting million dollar standardization deals.","wordCount":44},{"sentence":"We know from recent conversations with Tableau that this is a major focus area for them, and we think that some tweaks to the model could unlock significant amounts of spending.","wordCount":31},{"sentence":"Company ServiceNow FireEye Hortonworks Splunk Tableau Qlik dollar onemn Deals two hundred thirty one hundred thirty nine twenty two one hundred two

beat due to lower than expected taxes.","wordCount":15},{"sentence":"Licenses did continue their double digit declines, but our main takeaway from the quarter is that the cloud revenue mechanics are finally working as expected, and the revenue is flowing through the income statement.","wordCount":34},{"sentence":"We hosted Varonis CEO Yaki Faitelson for investor meetings in Boston this week.","wordCount":13},{"sentence":"Varonis' focus on data governance and security seems to be resonating well with customers who are increasingly looking at the growing threat of maliciously acting insiders.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"It seems that this can help to drive greater sales velocity, which should help overall numbers.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"We hosted meetings with management, and we learned two incremental things: the TTP product can double security revenue per customer, which we estimate could be a dollar forty sixtyM revenue opportunity inside the customer base alone, and competitor McAfee is end oflifing their competing email product, which we think MIME will benefit from, supporting the ~twenty percent revenue growth we are forecasting through FYeighteen.","wordCount":64},{"sentence":"Fundamentally, we think MIME represents growth at a reasonable price and gives investors exposure to the secular trend of email and its related security,
