the non OPEC/non US oil producers.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"We think that Nigeria and Venezuela will continue their downward production trend.","wordCount":12},{"sentence":"Meanwhile, Iraqi production growth to recent records may reverse due to the government's call to international oil companies to suspend or draw down their two thousand sixteen work plans in order to save on costs .","wordCount":35},{"sentence":"We also think that Angola production could begin to trend lower reflecting the lack of new major projects being sanctioned since late two thousand

potential production uplift from the Neutral Zone and Libya collectively is bigger than the potential uplift from Iran.","wordCount":27},{"sentence":"Despite our expectation that US onshore oil production will remain in a downward trend over the next several quarters, we expect imports to stay elevated due to rising floating storage costs, which in turn will lead to a buildup of crude inventories in PADDs two and three collectively by an average of three four million barrels per week.","wordCount":58},{"sentence":"Barclays | ConocoPhillips believe the US will actually run out of crude storage, we expect the inventory build will put downward pressure on WTI Cushing and US prices over the next several months.","wordCount":33},{"sentence":"Refining outlook On the refining side, while Barclays' US, European and Asian representative refining margin indicators' have plunged since reaching impressive near term highs during the summer of two thousand fifteen, each has recently posted its own modest respective recovery.","wordCount":40},{"sentence":"In fact, each of these margins is still above its respective two year seasonally adjusted average.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"While we acknowledge they are threatened in the near term by the currently high global inventory levels, we think any inventories surplus or deficit could potentially be corrected relatively quickly as the current stock levels represent a fraction of the supply/demand balance.","wordCount":42},{"sentence":"Thus the inventory levels were never a useful indicator for the long term margin outlook.","wordCount":15},{"sentence":"Aiding US refining margins over the next several months, we believe, will be a modest widening of the North American crude oil differentials.","wordCount":23},{"sentence":"Although we expect US onshore oil production to continue trending lower at least through the first half of two thousand sixteen, we expect it to be outweighed by lower demand from refinery turnaround activities.","wordCount":34},{"sentence":"Perhaps more importantly, we believe imports will stay elevated, as we think the recent sharp rise of the VLCC tanker day rate will both widen the contango and alter the import economics from West Africa to the US Gulf Coast.","wordCount":40},{"sentence":"With the current global oversupply, onshore storage facilities in Africa and the North Sea are filling, with producers turning to floating storage.","wordCount":22},{"sentence":"But with the high VLCC rates, we expect much of these barrels to make their way into the US Gulf Coast, pressuring LLS into breakeven or dollar one dollar two/b discount versus Brent through.","wordCount":34},{"sentence":"This in turn should push WTI Cushing prices

possibly rob the company of an important source of resource growth over the long term.","wordCount":42},{"sentence":"Since it is impossible to rebuild an entire deepwater program in a short period of
