fully address the issue, we need to answer the following set of questions:","wordCount":17},{"sentence":"If oil prices average dollar thirty five for the next two years, by how much would COP need to cut the dividend to live within this limit?","wordCount":27},{"sentence":"Our short answer to the above questions is that we believe there is a slightly more than fifty percent probability that COP will cut its dividend over the next couple of quarters.","wordCount":32},{"sentence":"We also believe COP should act when the company reports fourQfifteen results in early February and that it should reduce the dividend by at least seventy five percent .","wordCount":28},{"sentence":"Although we think the shares would face short term pressure due to the dividend cut, they should stabilize after a

surprising the market would be far greater.","wordCount":21},{"sentence":"As there is clearly some expectation of a cut priced in, the inevitable blow to the stock price would not be as severe.","wordCount":23},{"sentence":"But, is an expectation of a thirty four percent cut enough?","wordCount":11},{"sentence":"It is a start, but as discussed below, we think the cut should be far greater in magnitude somewhere in the area of seventy five percent and therefore management would probably feel more comfortable if expectations were lower.","wordCount":38},{"sentence":"Although management has never publicly addressed this question, we think the answer is likely `no', particularly under the current depressed and uncertain market environment.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"While the absolute funding cost difference between BBB+ and A is","wordCount":11},{"sentence":"Barclays | ConocoPhillips currently not huge, we believe it is a slippery slope and would put the company in a potentially difficult position if the oil market does not recover quickly.","wordCount":31},{"sentence":"We do not believe management and the Board would be willing to take such a risk.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"According to our colleague Harry Mateer, Barclays' high grade energy credit analyst, the risk of COP being downgraded to BBB+ or lower is real and present if the dividend payout is maintained at the current level and prices do not recover.","wordCount":41},{"sentence":"Please refer to Harry Mateer's section of this report for more detail.","wordCount":12},{"sentence":"We think the cut should be around seventy five percent from COP's current dividend commitment of dollar three.seven billion in two thousand sixteen.","wordCount":24},{"sentence":"Based on our current two thousand sixteen Brent oil price assumption of dollar forty six, capex of dollar seven.seven billion and asset sales of dollar four hundred million, COP will run a free cash flow deficit of around dollar four. billion this year.","wordCount":44},{"sentence":"However, at the future strip of around dollar thirty two, and even after lowering capex to the sustaining level of dollar six.","wordCount":22},{"sentence":"dollar six.five billion, we estimate the company would burn around ~ dollar five.five billion in cash.","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"We do not doubt the company's ability to withstand one year of low dollar thirty oil, but anything beyond that is dangerous territory and would eventually force COP to act drastically.","wordCount":31},{"sentence":"Because we do not believe that a BBB+ or lower credit rating would be acceptable to the Board or management, we estimate that a seventy five percent dividend cut to around dollar nine hundred million would leave COP with a more manageable free cash flow deficit of around dollar two.eight billion under the low oil price scenario.","wordCount":58},{"sentence":"hit to the stock price would likely be significant, especially given certain shareholders have dividend mandates and may be forced to sell.","wordCount":22},{"sentence":"Subsequently, however, we think the shares could recover if the dividend were cut enough to eliminate concerns that the company could manage in a low oil price environment for two three years.","wordCount":32},{"sentence":"On the other hand, the shares are likely to remain under pressure if the dividend is not trimmed sufficiently, and concerns will persist over the company's ability to maintain its credit rating and whether the dividend would have to be further reduced in the future.","wordCount":45},{"sentence":"We think a sufficient cut would actually allow COP to outperform other E and P names for the rest of the downturn and beyond because COP would become one of the sector's lowest risk names within the sector.","wordCount":38},{"sentence":"As a recent example, we look at how Husky Energy performed after announcing their dividend suspension on one/nineteen/sixteen, and their stock dividend at the end of threeQfifteen.","wordCount":27},{"sentence":"After initially dipping fourteen percent in the morning on one/twenty/sixteen, the stock finished down three.three","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"On the other hand, after swapping its cash dividend for a stock dividend at the end of threeQfifteen, HSE was down about thirty three percent through one/nineteen/sixteen compared to the Canadian average down only sixteen percent .","wordCount":36},{"sentence":"While the stock dividend was a milder initial jolt to investors, it failed to completely remove concerns of whether the company could manage in a low oil price environment.","wordCount":29},{"sentence":"However, once the dividend was fully removed and the concerns were more fully addressed, the company's shares fared less poorly.","wordCount":20},{"sentence":"We estimate that with a seventy five percent dividend cut and capex at the sustaining level of dollar six.","wordCount":19},{"sentence":"dollar six.five billion, COP could be cash flow neutral at dollar forty five dollar fifty Brent, a proposition that few E and P companies could match.","wordCount":27},{"sentence":"As oil prices recover, this reset would allow COP to allocate capital to growth opportunities and, given it has probably the best unconventional resource portfolio of any major oil company, we think COP could grow production at two three percent per year even at dollar fifty dollar sixty oil.","wordCount":49},{"sentence":"From the new, lower dividend base, we think this would allow it to grow the dividend","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"Barclays | ConocoPhillips consistently going forward, at four percent five percent per year, while at the same time reducing the share count by buying back stock.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"The production, cash flow and dividend growth rate could be substantially higher if oil prices average over dollar eighty per barrel over the next ten years.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"More importantly, the new financial and operating flexibility will be among the best in the E and P sector.","wordCount":19},{"sentence":"In our view, the new value proposition would be more superior than prior, since it would not be based on dollar one hundred oil price.","wordCount":25},{"sentence":"Based on our above analysis, we conclude that there is a more than fifty percent probability the company will cut the dividend in oneHsixteen, and we think management should act when it reports fourQfifteen results in early February.","wordCount":38},{"sentence":"Although the company continued to insistently defend its dividend policy on its December budget conference call, the global oil market has since fallen by more than dollar fifteen/b in less than two months, with the two thousand sixteen and two thousand seventeen future strips averaging less than dollar thirty five.","wordCount":50},{"sentence":"The pace and magnitude of the price decline has caught even the most seasoned industry observers off guard, but it has in turn offered an excellent window for COP to press the reset button on its dividend policy, in our opinion.","wordCount":41},{"sentence":"Critically, we think that by biting the bullet now, COP would at least be doing so while it still has a choice, and thus greater financial flexibility to carry it out.","wordCount":31},{"sentence":"Should the company forego the current opportunity, and should the oil market remain depressed, it could be forced into cutting the dividend at a point where it has zero optionality and the long term damage to the company would be more severe.","wordCount":42},{"sentence":"Equally important, we believe a significant dividend cut would actually improve the company's long term competitive position.","wordCount":17},{"sentence":"COP would become one of the sector's lowest breakeven cost and highest free cash flow producers.","wordCount":16},{"sentence":"From this new base line, we estimate the company could grow production by two three percent while increasing the dividend by four five percent p.a. even within a dollar fifty dollar sixty oil price environment.","wordCount":36},{"sentence":"High Grade Credit Research Harry Mateer * +one two hundred twelve four hundred twelve seven thousand nine hundred three

combination with continued negative free cash flow, will put pressure on the company's credit metrics such that its current ratings are at significant risk.","wordCount":40},{"sentence":"Ultimately, we think that a dividend reduction is a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, step for the company to try to salvage its single A status.","wordCount":26},{"sentence":"Although rating agencies take a multi year view when it comes to assessing their credit ratings, we note that price assumptions for two thousand sixteen and beyond continue to fall and will only increase the likelihood of downgrades across the E and P sector.","wordCount":44},{"sentence":"COP benefits from significant size and scale, which has historically afforded it a premium versus other issuers, even when they have superior leverage metrics, but we think that the agencies will be placing greater weight on cash flow metrics as margins have deteriorated.","wordCount":43},{"sentence":"Moody's currently indicates a downside threshold for a one notch downgrade to Athree of twenty percent retained cash flow to debt, while S and P would be likely to cut its rating if FFO to debt falls below thirty percent .","wordCount":40},{"sentence":"As seen in Figure one, we estimate that it is unlikely for COP to meet the agencies' requirements in two thousand sixteen under any of our scenarios, including those in which the company eliminates its dividend entirely.","wordCount":37},{"sentence":"Given that Moody's currently has the lowest price deck, we are using those prices for our rating agency case scenario .","wordCount":20},{"sentence":"percent in the best ratings case, we think that it is possible for COP to fall out of the single A category.","wordCount":22},{"sentence":"Because the agencies tend to move cautiously when it comes to ratings downgrades, our base case expectation is that COP will fall to low A in the near term, with further downside ratings risk later in two thousand sixteen if the oil price is sustained below dollar forty/bbl.","wordCount":48},{"sentence":"Away from credit ratings, we think that our leverage estimates imply that management needs to act with urgency.","wordCount":18},{"sentence":"Our unadjusted net debt/EBITDA estimates range from five.eightx to over tenx, but are too high regardless in a sector that has historically been valued at roughly sixx cash flow.","wordCount":30},{"sentence":"Notwithstanding the potential for oil prices eventually to move higher, we think that credit markets are skeptical about extending capital to companies that are highly leveraged on a spot commodity price deck, even for an issuer as large as COP.","wordCount":40},{"sentence":"At present, COP has a dollar forty fivebn market cap, but we think that the longer management waits before taking decisive action, the more likely that not only a dividend cut, but also a potential capital raise, will be required to strengthen the capital structure.","wordCount":45},{"sentence":"We have an Underweight rating on COP, given our view that the credit ratings could eventually migrate below single A, triggering selling from some bondholders and repricing the credit in line with BBB E and P issuers during what is a risk off market for commodity producers.","wordCount":47},{"sentence":"We acknowledge that COP's size provides it with options that other companies may not have, such as non cash flowing assets that could be monetized and facilitate deleveraging, but we also see risk that management's refusal so far to consider a dividend cut might leave the balance sheet in worse shape before the company takes action.","wordCount":56},{"sentence":"Although we think that a dividend reduction is likely to spur some spread
